# [WIP] glot

(sublime plugin) put/run your code on [glot.io](https://glot.io),
requires an api token to work.

## Do

1. edit the 'token' in settings (get your own at https://glot.io/account/token)
2. Ctrl-Shift-P, _glot: Open Snippet_ will open one of your snippets  
   it only does open, nothing more :-/
3. edit an existing file like `a.py`, then _glot: Run_  
   a few seconds later it will show results in an output panel

## Todo

support all apis from glot.io, including _snippets_ and _run_.
